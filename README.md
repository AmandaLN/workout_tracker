# Workout Tracker
## Description
In this assignment I created a workout tracker. The user will be able to add exercises to the most recent workout plan, add new exercises to a new workout plan. As well as view the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page and view the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
